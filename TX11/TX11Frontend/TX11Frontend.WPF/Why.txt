Why does this WPF app exist if there is already a UWP app?
	- Mostly because of debugging reasons! Due to network isolation you cannot recieve any incomming connections from the same computer within any UWP app.
	 This makes debugging a pain, as you always need two pcs to debug - not even a vm works.
	 WPF doesn not have such restrictions.
