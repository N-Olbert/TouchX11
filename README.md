# TouchX11 
TouchX11 (TX11) is a cross-plattform X11-Server implementation.

It is optimized for touch screen use (well, at least a bit :wink:).

Currently, supported platforms are: iOS, Android, Windows (WPF)


# Remarks
While more or less fully functional most code which has not been ported is undocumented. This is due to the fact that this project is part of a time-bound research paper.


# Build
1. Clone repro
2. Open solution in Visual Studio (tested with Visual Studio 2019)
3. Set appropriate startup project
4. Build

(Additional tasks may be required to set up the environment, f. e. install vcremote on Mac)
